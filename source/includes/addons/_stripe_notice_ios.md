If your users are messaging you by via our [Twilio](#twilio) or [Telegram](#telegram) integrations, they'll get a web link instead of a buy button. It will take them to a payment web page where we use [Checkout.js](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) from Stripe to secure the payment. This mechanism is also used for Smooch iOS SDK versions older than 3.3.
