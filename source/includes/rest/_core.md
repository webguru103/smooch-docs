# Introduction

Welcome to the Smooch API. The API allows you to craft entirely unique messaging experiences for your app and website as well as talk to any backend or external service.

## Basics

The Smooch API is designed according to [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles.

The API accepts JSON in request bodies and requires that the `content-type: application/json` header be specified for all such requests. The API will always respond with a JSON object. Depending on context, resources may be returned as single objects or as arrays of objects, nested within the response object.

The API also facilitates [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) so that it can be called from a web application.

## Errors

```
401 Unauthorized
```
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "description": "Authorization is required"
  }
}
```

Smooch uses standard HTTP status codes to communicate errors

|         |   |
|---------|---|
| **200** | OK - Everything went as planned. |
| **400** | Bad Request - Something in your header or request body was malformed. |
| **401** | Unauthorized - Necessary credentials were either missing or invalid. |
| **403** | Forbidden - Your credentials are valid but you don't have access to the requested resource. |
| **404** | Not Found - The object you're requesting doesn't exist. |
| **409** | Conflict - You might be trying to update the same resource concurrently. |
| **429** | Too Many Requests - You are calling our APIs more frequently than we allow. |
| **500, 502, 503, 504** | Server Errors - Something went wrong on our end. |

In addition to the status code, the HTTP body of the response will also contain a JSON representation of the error.

## Rate Limits

Smooch APIs are subject to rate limiting.  If you exceed the limits, Smooch will start returning a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code. We apply rate limits to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service attacks, and similar issues. Our goal is to keep the limits high enough so that any application using Smooch as intended will never hit them. However, applications that consistently exceed limits run the risk of being permanently disabled.

## Deprecations

The "devices" array returned in the AppUser payload has been changed to "clients". In order to maintain compatibility, we will keep returning the "devices" array in v1, but in the next version it will be removed.

# Authorization

This is an overview of how authorization works with the Smooch API.

Smooch offers two methods for authentication JSON Web Token (JWT) and app token. [See below](#authentication) for more details. There are three different scopes of authorization available. These are _appUser_, _app_, and _appMaker_.

| Scope        | Methods  | Authorized APIs  |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **appUser** | JWT, appToken | [Init](#init), [App User](#app-user), [Conversations](#conversations) |
| **app**      | JWT           |  [Webhooks](#webhooks), [Init](#init), [App User](#app-user), [Conversations](#conversations) [Persistent Menus](#persistent-menus) |
| **appMaker**| JWT           | All APIs  |

**App user scoped JWTs** are user specific, and once specified, secure a user so that only a JWT scoped specifically for that user (or an app or app maker JWT) can be used to call the API on behalf of that user.

The **appToken** authentication method only allows you to call the API on behalf of users who have not yet been secured by an app user scoped JWT.

**App scoped JWTs** can be used to access any of the Smooch Core APIs on behalf of the app, or any app user.

For more information on **app maker scope**, please [see the Inside API](#inside).

# Authentication

Smooch APIs offer two methods of authentication:

1. Using an [App Token](#app-token)
2. Using a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](#jwt)

Some APIs accept either of the two authentication methods while others require a `jwt` credential.

| API                          | Valid authentication methods |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [`/v1/appusers`](#app-user)  | `jwt`, `appToken`            |
| [`/v1/init`](#init)          | `jwt`, `appToken`            |
| [`/v1/webhooks`](#webhook)   | `jwt`                        |

## App Token


```shell
# Calling GET /v1/appusers using an app token
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/appusers/c7f6e6d6c3a637261bd9656f \
     -H 'app-token: cr2g6jgxrahuh68n1o3e2fcnt'
```

```js
// Initializing Smooch Core with an app token
var smooch = new SmoochCore({
    appToken: 'cr2g6jgxrahuh68n1o3e2fcnt'
});
```

When calling Smooch APIs such as [`/v1/appusers`](#app-users) on behalf of app users, an `appToken` may be used for basic authentication.

Every Smooch app has an `appToken` provisioned to it which can be found in the app settings tab. The `appToken` is sent via the the `app-token` HTTP header. This will link the caller to a specific Smooch app.

Specifying an `appToken` alone is sufficient to call any of the app user facing API.

## JWT


```shell
# Calling GET /v1/appusers using a jwt
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/appusers/c7f6e6d6c3a637261bd9656f \
     -H 'authorization: Bearer your-jwt'
```
```js
// Initializing Smooch Core with a jwt in the browser
var smooch = new SmoochCore({
    jwt: 'your-jwt'
});
```
```js
// Initializing Smooch Core with a jwt in Node.js
var smooch = new SmoochCore({
    keyId: 'your-key-id',
    secret: 'your-secret',
    scope: 'appUser', // app or appUser
    userId: 'some-id' // not necessary if scope === 'app'
});
```

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an industry standard authentication mechanism. The full specification is described [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), and a set of supported JWT libraries for a variety of languages and platforms can be found at [http://jwt.io](http://jwt.io). To summarize, a JWT is composed of a header, a payload, and a signature. The payload contains information called *claims* which describe the subject to whom the token was issued.

For added security when making calls on behalf of an app user, a `jwt` credential can optionally be specified instead of an `appToken`.

The `jwt` itself is transmitted via the HTTP `authorization` header. The token should be prefixed with "Bearer" followed by a space. For example: `Bearer your-jwt`.

To sign JWTs, you will need to create a secret key in the Smooch dashboard, by going into the Settings tab. Clicking on "Create New Secret Key" will generate a new key id and a secret key pair which you can use to sign JWTs.

<aside class="warning">
After using a `jwt` with `appUser` scope to authenticate an app user for the `/appuser` or `/init` routes, it becomes no longer possible to authenticate that app user with an `appToken`.
</aside>

### Header

> JWT header:

```json
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT",
    "kid": "b567635f883c819871ace8003c0db14b"
}
```

The JWT header must contain the key id (`kid`) of the secret key that is used to sign it. The algorithm (`alg`) used to sign the JWT can be anything supported by the [jsonwebtoken npm module v5.0.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#algorithms-supported). Unsigned JWTs are not accepted.

> JWT payload with `appUser` scope claim:

```json
{
    "scope": "appUser",
    "userId": "bob@example.com"
}
```

> JWT payload with `app` scope:

```json
{
    "scope": "app"
}
```

### Scope

The `jwt` payload must include a `scope` claim which specifies the caller's scope of access. There are two levels of scope:

1. The `appUser` scope grants access to an individual app user's data and conversation history, but nothing else. It is used when issuing tokens to individual users. A `jwt` with `appUser` scope must also specify a `userId` which uniquely identifies the `appUser` being accessed. [Node.js code sample](https://gist.github.com/alavers/8f07b03895333d83b454)

1. The `app` scope grants access to all users and conversations within a given Smooch app. The `app` scope is reserved for server-to-server scenarios, the creation of webhooks for example. [Node.js code sample](https://gist.github.com/alavers/d9af102ca4cefac1a7e5)

| API                       | Accepted `jwt` Scopes |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| [/v1/appusers](#app-user) | app, appUser          |
| [/v1/webhooks](#webhook)  | app                   |

# Webhooks

Webhooks are a fantastic way to extend the Smooch platform beyond the built-in feature set. You can use webhooks to build your own Smooch chat clients, to integrate more deeply with your favorite CRM, or to [build a bot](https://github.com/smooch/smooch-bot).

These webhook APIs require a `jwt` credential with `app` level scope. Furthermore, a webhook can only operate within the scope of a single Smooch app.

When a webhook trigger is triggered, a JSON payload will be posted to the URL configured in your webhook object. You can see an example of this payload [here](#webhooks-payload).

## Create webhook

> Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/webhooks \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"target": "http://example.com/callback"}' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -H 'authorization: Bearer your-jwt'
```

```js
smooch.webhooks.create({
    target: 'http://example.com/callback'
}).then((response) => {
    // async code
});
```

> Response:

```
201 CREATED
```
```json
{

    ],
    "secret": "8564b3e6a8b20a4bdb68b05d9ea97aace9bc5936",
    "target": "http://example.com/callback"
  }
}
```

<api>`POST /v1/webhooks`</api>

Create a webhook for the specified app. The response body will include a list of triggers that will trigger the webhook (currently only message triggers are supported) as well as a secret which will be transmitted with each webhook invocation and can be used to verify the authenticity of the caller.

Alternatively, you can use the Webhooks integration in the Smooch dashboard to easily create a webhook.

| **Arguments**             |   |
|---------------------------|---|
| **target**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | URL to be called when the webhook is triggered. |
| **triggers**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>  | An array of triggers you wish to have the webhook listen to. If unspecified the default trigger is `message`. This property is case sensitive. [More details](#webhook-triggers). |

    // async code
});
```

> Response:

```
200 OK
```

<api>`DELETE /v1/webhooks/{webhookId}`</api>

## Webhook triggers

> Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/webhooks
     -X POST \
     -d '{"target": "http://example.com/callback", "triggers": ["message:appUser"]}' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -H 'authorization: Bearer your-jwt'
```

```js
smooch.webhooks.create({
    target: 'http://example.com/callback',
    triggers: [
        'message:appUser'
    ]
}).then((response) => {
    // async code
});
```

A webhook will make a request to the target each time a trigger associated with the webhook occurs. Triggers are specified in an optional `triggers` array in the request body. If `triggers` is not specified the webhook will be configured with the `message` trigger by default.

A webhook with a `postback` trigger will be fired every time a user clicks on [an action button with type `postback`](#action-buttons).

| trigger          |   |
|------------------|---|
| **message**<br/>*default* | all messages            |
| **message:appUser**       | only app user messages  |
| **message:appMaker**      | only app maker messages |
| **postback**              | when a user clicks on a postback action |

When a webhook trigger is triggered, a `POST` request will be made to the URL configured in your webhook object along with a JSON payload.

The structure of the JSON payload differs based on the trigger of the webhook. On the right, you can see examples of the JSON payload for the different triggers. Postbacks originating from a [persistent menu](#persistent-menus) do not have messages associated with them, and so omit the message property.

## Securing a webhook

When a webhook is created, a shared secret will be generated for it. The secret can be used to determine the veracity of a request to your webhook route. It is included as an `X-API-Key` header with each webhook request sent to the target URL.

That secret is available in the response to the POST request used to generate the webhook, or through a GET request to the webhook route.

## Retry Policy

If a webhook target responds with anything other than a 2xx status code, or if no response is received within 5 seconds, the call will be reattempted up to 5 times at an exponentially increasing interval.

<api>`POST /v1/init`</api>

This API is called by a mobile device or browser when the app is first loaded. It serves a number of purposes:

1. Initializes a new `appUser` and `device` if they don't yet exist
1. Updates an existing app user's profile and device information
1. Authenticates the `appUser` if `jwt` credentials are provided

The API requires that a `device` be specified at the very minimum. A `userId` may also be specified to [link app user accounts across devices](/#users-on-multiple-devices).

The API responds with an `appUser` object. The `appUser` includes an `_id` that can be used to make further API calls on behalf of that user. If the `userId` and/or `device.id` are seen for the first time a new `appUser` will be created. If not, the existing `appUser` be returned.

An `app` object is also returned which includes metadata about the app, such as information about push notification channels.

| **Arguments**               |   |
|-----------------------------|---|
| **device**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | A descriptor of the user's device. See below. |
| **userId**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | A unique identifier for the app user. Unlike the `smoochId` which is generated by Smooch, the `userId` is chosen by the API consumer. The `userId` can be used to link a user to the same conversation [across multiple devices](/#users-on-multiple-devices).|

<aside class="warning">
**Caution:** If you're specifying a `userId` then in order to keep conversations private we strongly suggest [authenticating your users](/#authenticating-users-optional). If a `userId` is used without a JWT credential, then anyone who can discover a user's `userId` could potentially eavesdrop on the conversation.
</aside>

## Device

If a `userId` is used when calling `/v1/init`, then devices and app users may have a many-to-many relationship. A single `userId` may use Smooch from multiple devices and multiple different `userId`s may log in to the same device.

<aside class="notice">
*Note:* Only one `userId` can be active on a given device at a time. On a device that's shared between multiple `userId`s, only the most recent `userId` to have called `/v1/init` will receive push notifications from the integrated application on that device.
</aside>

| **`device` arguments**      |   |
|-----------------------------|---|
| **id**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | An identifier for the device. Must be globally unique. |
| **platform**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | `ios`, `android`, `web`, or `other` |
| **pushNotificationToken**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | The GCM or APN token to be used for sending push notifications to the device.
| **appVersion**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | A reserved string field for reporting the app version running on the device. For example: `8.0` |
| **info**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | A flat JSON structure detailing device properties. See below. |

## Device Info

The `device` object may also accept a flat `info` JSON object. Device information reported here will be rendered alongside app user information inside any app maker channels configured with Smooch. The `platform` and `appVersion` fields are special in that they can be used as audience targeting criteria for whispers.

| Field                     | Example                   | Relevant Platforms |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **appName**               | `foo`                     | ios, android       |
| **deviceModel**           | `iPhone 5s`               | ios, android       |
| **os**                    | `iPhone OS`               | ios, android       |
| **osVersion**             | `8.1.2`                   | ios, android       |
| **radioAccessTechnology** | `HSDPA`                   | ios, android       |
| **carrier**               | `Acme`                    | ios, android       |
| **devicePlatform**        | `iPhone6,1`               | ios, android       |
| **wifi**                  | `YES`                     | ios, android       |
| **currentUrl**            | `http://mywebsite.com`    | web                |
| **userAgent**             | `Mozilla/5.0...`          | web                |
| **referrer**              | `http://google.com`       | web                |
| **browserLanguage**       | `en-US`                   | web                |
| **currentTittle**         | `Welcome`                 | web                |

The API will respond with the `_id` of the app user in question, which can then be used to make API calls to the conversation API. The response will also include any profile information that was previously set for the app user, including custom properties.

<aside class="notice">
In some scenarios, the `appUser._id` returned in an app boot call may change. This is possible for example when the `userId` is being used to log a user in on multiple devices, which may cause two distinct app users to merge together. The caller should always check if the returned `appUser._id` has changed, and re-fetch conversation history whenever appropriate.
</aside>

# App User

The app user object represents an end user using your app. The app user document contains basic profile information such as `givenName`, `surname`, and `email`, as well as any custom user properties you choose to configure.

The `/v1/appusers` path gives you APIs that can be used to update the user's properties, retrieve conversation history, post a message, and track app user events.

### userId

App users may be created with an optional `userId` parameter. This is a unique identifier that is chosen by the API consumer and it can be used to synchronize a single conversation across multiple devices. To understand how this works, see the section covering [users on multiple devices](/#users-on-multiple-devices).

<aside class="notice">
If a `userId` has been specified for a given app user, it can be used in place of the `appUser._id` in any `/v1/appusers/` API path.

<api>`POST /v1/appusers/{smoochId|userId}/events`</api>

Trigger an event for a given app user. Some Smooch whispers are triggered on discrete events. This API is used to trigger such events. For example, if an app has a whisper configured to be sent whenever a user has triggered the `completed_sale` event, calling this API is the way to trigger such a whisper.

| **Arguments**           |   |
|-------------------------|---|
| **name**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | The name of the triggered event. |

        "conversationStarted": false,
        "credentialRequired": false
    }
}
```

<api>`POST /v1/appusers`</api>

| **Arguments**                 |                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **userId**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>     | A unique identifier for the app user. The `userId` can be used to link a user to the same conversation [across multiple devices](/#users-on-multiple-devices).|
| **credentialRequired**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | Default is `false`. Set to `true` to ensure that the created app user requires a `jwt` credential. See [authenticating your users](/#authenticating-users-optional) for more information.
| **givenName**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>  | The user's given name (first name). |
| **surname**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>    | The user's surname (last name). |
| **email**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>      | The user's email address. |
| **signedUpAt**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | The date at which the user signed up. Must be ISO 8601 time format (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`) |
| **properties**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | A flat JSON object containing custom defined user properties. |

In the vast majority of cases app users will be created from the device or browser using the [init API](#init). In some cases however it might be necessary to pre-create an app user object before that user runs your app for the first time. This API facilitates this scenario. A `userId` must be specified so that a future `init` call made from a device can use the same `userId` to link the device to the pre-created app user.

Suppose for example you begin a conversation with an end user `bob@example.com` over email and you wish to transfer this conversation history over into Smooch once that user logs in to your app. To facilitate this, you can call `POST /v1/appusers` to pre-create a Smooch identity with `userId` `bob@example.com`, to which you can import that existing conversation history. After Bob signs in to your app and your app calls `init` with the same `userId`, they will see their conversation history.

<aside class="notice">
Unlike the other App User APIs in this section, this endpoint is not intended to be called from an end user device or from a browser. It requires a `jwt` credential with `app` level scope.

```

<api>`POST /v1/appusers/{smoochId|userId}/channels`</api>

| **Arguments**                 |                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **type**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>     | The channel to link.|
| **{entity}**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | The required entity for linking. This is [different for each channel](#linkable-channels-and-entities).|
| **skipConfirmation**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | Flag to specify whether or not the confirmation message is sent. Requires app scope JWT.|

Linking allows users to continue conversations on their preferred channels. An appUser's linked channels will be found in the `clients` field.

When a link request is first made, the channel will be added to the `pendingClients` field. The appUser is then prompted to accept the linking request. If they do so, the corresponding channel is then moved from the `pendingClients` field to `clients` field. If they reject the linking request then the channel is removed from `pendingClients`.

It is possible to skip the confirmation step with the `skipConfirmation` flag. App scope JWT is required to specify the confirmation option.

### Linkable channels and entities

Given that there is no way for you to provide Smooch with the necessary ID to connect Messenger, LINE, WeChat or Telegram, we have limited the API to only accept ‘Twilio’ for now.
Support for Frontend Email is coming soon.

| Channel type                 | Required entity              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| twilio                       | **phoneNumber**<br/> A String of the appUser's phone number. It must contain the `+` prefix and the country code.<br/> Examples of valid phone numbers: `+1 212-555-2368`, `+12125552368`, `+1 212 555 2368`.<br/> Examples of invalid phone numbers: `212 555 2368`, `1 212 555 2368`.                  |

<api>`GET /v1/appusers/{smoochId|userId}/messages`</api>

Get the specified app user's conversation history with a limit of 100 messages, if it exists. If a conversation has not yet been created for the specified app user, 404 will be returned.

### Pagination

The API endpoint for retrieving messages of a conversation has a limit of a 100 messages. The `before` and `after` parameters will have to be specified to indicate which range of messages to return. These parameters are mutually exclusive. If neither is specified, then the most recent 100 messages will be returned.

| Parameter                | Description              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `before`                 | Timestamp of message. The API will return 100 messages before the specified timestamp (excluding any messages with the provided timestamp).           |
| `after`                  | Timestamp of message. The API will return 100 messages after the specified timestamp (excluding any messages with the provided timestamp).            |

<aside class="notice">
The timestamp format should be in seconds using [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). Note that you can specify milliseconds using a decimal number if needed.

<api>`POST /v1/appusers/{smoochId|userId}/messages`</api>

Post a message to the app user. If the app user does not yet have a conversation, one will be created automatically. Messages must have a `role` of either `appuser` or `appMaker`. Furthermore, a message must have a `text`, `actions`, `items`, or `mediaUrl` specified. Some parameters are mutually exclusive, indicated in the table blow.

Images can be posted by reference using this API by specifying the `mediaUrl` parameter. Alternatively, you may also upload images to the conversation directly using the [`/images`](#upload-image) endpoint.

<aside class="notice">
For messages originating from an app maker, a `jwt` credential with `app` level scope must be used.
</aside>

Carousel messages are a horizontally scrollable set of items that may each contain text, an image, and action buttons. Not all messaging channels fully support carousel messages; currently only Facebook Messenger and Telegram cover the full functionality. For all other platforms a carousel message is rendered as raw text. The raw text fallback does not include any images or postback action buttons.

<aside class="notice">
Only the `appMaker` role can used to send a carousel message.
</aside>

### Carousel Item

| **Arguments**                |                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **title**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>       | The title of the carousel item. |
| **actions**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>     | Array of carousel actions. At least 1 is required, a maximum of 3 are allowed. Only `link` and `postback` actions are supported. |
| **description**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span> | The text description, or subtitle. |
| **mediaUrl**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>   | The image URL to be shown in the carousel item. |
| **mediaType**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>   | If a `mediaUrl` was specified, the media type is defined here, for example `image/jpeg`. If `mediaType` is not specified, the media type will be resolved with the `mediaUrl`. |

### Carousel Actions

Carousel actions have the same structure as [action buttons](#action-buttons), however only `link`, `postback` and `share` action types are permitted.

      actions: [{
        type: 'share'
      }]
    }]
}).then(() => {
    // async code
});
```

Carousel actions may also include a share button. Currently, this feature is only supported in Facebook Messenger. For more information, see the Facebook Messenger platform [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/share-button).

### Channel Support for Carousel Messages

Smooch will deliver carousel messages to users across all messaging channels regardless of whether or not a given channel can natively render a carousel message UI. For channels that don't render carousels, a raw text representation is sent. In the future, the Smooch API will expand to support new messaging app carousel experiences as they become available. For current messaging channels, carousel messages will render in the following ways:

#### Facebook Messenger
Full support.
![messenger carousel](/images/carousel_messenger.png)

#### Telegram
Full support, with cards arranged vertically.
![telegram carousel](/images/carousel_telegram.png)

> Sample Raw Text Format:

```
1. Tacos
Description
More info http://example.org

2. Ramen
Description
More info http://example.org
```

#### All Other Channels
Text fallback.

```

<api>`POST /v1/appusers/{smoochId|userId}/images`</api>

Upload an image and post it to the conversation. Images are uploaded using the `multipart/form-data` content type. Similar to the `/messages` endpoint, a `role` parameter must be specified. The `/images` endpoint accepts the same parameters as `/messages` but they are sent as form parameters as opposed to being encoded in JSON bodies. The uploaded image will render as part of the message thread in all supported app maker channels (email, Slack, HipChat, Zendesk, Helpscout).

| **Form Parameters**          |                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **source**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>    | The image data.            |
| **role**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>      | The role of the individual posting the message. Can be either `appUser` or `appMaker`. |

# Persistent Menus

Smooch provides a /v1/menu/ API to set persistent menus on messaging channels that support custom menus in their chat UIs ([Facebook Messenger](http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#facebook-messenger) and [WeChat](http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#wechat)).

# Smooch Connect

Smooch has a rapidly growing partner ecosystem which helps you unlock messaging in your product or service and lets customers find you alongside complementary partners. If you're interested in becoming a partner, tell us what you're building with Smooch using our [partner application](https://smooch.io/partners/) and we'll provision you with everything you'll need to build your end of the OAuth flow using Smooch Connect. In the meantime the OAuth endpoints detailed below can be tested by impersonating Shoplifter, a partnership we built for testing purposes.

## Add to Smooch Button

```html
<a href="https://app.smooch.io/oauth/authorize?client_id=shoplifter&response_type=code"><img alt="Add to Smooch" height="40" width="165" src="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png" srcset="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png 1x, https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch@2x.png 2x"/></a>
```

This HTML template can be used to place an "Add to Smooch" button on your website.

<p class="add-to-smooch-button">
    <a href="https://app.smooch.io/oauth/authorize?client_id=shoplifter&response_type=code"><img alt="Add to Smooch" height="40" width="165" src="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png" srcset="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png 1x, https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch@2x.png 2x"/></a>

curl https://app.smooch.io/oauth/authorize?client_id=shoplifter&response_type=code
```
```js
// This endpoint is not currently wrapped in a JavaScript lib
```

<api>`GET https://app.smooch.io/oauth/authorize`</api>

This endpoint begins the OAuth flow. It relies on a browser session for authentication. If the user is not logged in to Smooch they will be redirected to the login page. If the user has many apps, they will first be prompted to select the one they wish to integrate with. They will then be presented with an Allow/Deny dialog, describing details of the access your integration is requesting.

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **client_id**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | Your integration's unique identifier |
| **response_type**<br/><span class='req'>required</span>  | For now the only acceptable value is `code` |
| **state**<br/><span class='opt'>optional</span>  | You may pass in any arbitrary string value here which will be returned to you along with the code via browser redirect |

### Success Response

A successful response is delivered via a 302 redirect to the redirect URI configured by your integration.

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **code** | An authorization code which can be exchanged for an access token |
| **state** | Your state parameter (if one was provided) |

### Error Response

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **error**   | For example: `access_denied` |
| **state**   | Your state parameter (if one was provided) |

### Error Codes

| *Error Code* | *Delivery Method* | *Description* |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **access_denied** | 302 | The user denied access |

## Token Endpoint

> Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.smooch.io/oauth/token \
     -d code=your_code \
     -d grant_type=authorization_code \
     -d client_id=shoplifter \
     -d client_secret=secret
```
```js
// This endpoint is not currently wrapped in a JavaScript lib
```

<api>`POST https://app.smooch.io/oauth/token`</api>

This endpoint is used to exchange an authorization code for an access token. It should only be used in server-to-server calls.

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **code**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | The authorization code received via `/oauth/authorize` |
| **grant_type**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | Must be set to `authorization_code` |
| **client_id**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | Your integration's unique identifier |
| **client_secret**<br/><span class='req'>required</span> | Your integration's secret |

### Success Response:

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **access_token** | An access token that can now be used to call Smooch APIs |
| **token_type** | `Bearer`. All issued tokens are of this type |

## Scope

The default scope of an issued access token is `integration` scope. This allows API calls to be made to a specific Smooch app on behalf of an integration, identified by the integration's `clientId`. The access token grants permission to get and create app users and conversations associated with the app. The token also grants permission to create webhooks, however only webhooks created for the integration will be visible. An access token with `integration` scope cannot see or modify webhooks that were created by other integrations for example.

| *API Root*         | *Access*     |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **/v1/appusers/*** | Yes          |
| **/v1/webhooks/*** | Yes          |
| **/v1/menu/***     | No           |
