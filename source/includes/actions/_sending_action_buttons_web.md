## Links

You can send your users an action button with the following syntax:

```
%[Button label here](http://anyurl.com)
```

This works from any channel you configured to use with Smooch.

When the user taps your button, it'll open whatever link you specified in a new tab.

<span class="half-width-img">![Action buttons](/images/action_button_web.png)</span>

<aside class="notice">
Buttons will always be appended at the bottom of your message bubble.
